## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, jQuery

This was created with the handy dandy (and simplistic) help of math operators, parseFloat, and the .val() method. There is a function for each button with an event listener which parseFloats the values of each input and then divides, multiplies, adds, or subtracts accordingly.

## Optimizations

Going back I would use .html() to add the result in the dom instead of alerting the user.

## Lessons Learned:
Alert is annoying have to close out of consistently.

## Examples:
Take a look at all of the rest of my github projects!
